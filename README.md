## Summary:
You can see that this script is versatile and can be modified to work on various levels.  

a. Analyzing election results for a Student Body President or Class President can uses a very similar script. 
You could change some of the variables and make it more suitable for the situation.

b. Another example would be the electing local government. Once again, small changes in the variables and taking out county information would allow this piece of script to work.
